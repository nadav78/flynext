About the project
This project is presented from the business owner’s perspective, assuming limited technical familiarity with concepts like web development, Next.js, and APIs. Thus, the requirements are described non-technically, and your task is to design and implement a web application that fulfills them. There is much room for creativity, and you get decent freedom with respect to the details and various tools you can use for this project. Still, you must use Next.js, Prisma, REST, React, TailwindCSS, and Docker. Beside these, you can utilize any existing package, library, and open-source code to improve your app.

The project is divided into two parts. In part 1, you will use Next.js, Prisma, and REST Framework to implement the backend of the project. In part 2, you will implement the frontend using React and TailwindCSS and connect the backend to it. You will also use Docker to make your full application portable and deploy it on the internet. The eventual outcome of this project is a deployed, portable, and fully-functional web application that meets the user stories listed in an upcoming section.
Environment
Your application must run in an Ubuntu 22.04 machine that has Node.js 20+ and SQLite3 installed. It is fine if you are developing your code on other operating systems, although Windows is strongly discouraged. However, it is your responsibility to make sure that your server and scripts (described later) run without any problem on Ubuntu 22.04 before submitting.

FlyNext features
The following sections outline the features to be included in FlyNext. These features are presented as user stories to reflect the experience from the perspective of imaginary users. Each story is written in non-technical terms, leaving specific design and implementation details to you.

User stories are categorized by user types:

As a visitor: Features available to all website visitors, logged in or not.
As a user: Features accessible only to authenticated users.
As a hotel owner: Features designed specifically for users managing hotels on the platform.
Important note: Some of the features described below are not applicable in this part of the project. However, it is essential to understand the full scope of the application to design it effectively.

Accounts
As a user, I want to sign up, log in, log out, and edit my profile. Profile information includes first and last name, email, profile picture, and phone number. Authentication should be handled with a proper JWT setup.
Flights search
As a visitor, I want to search for flights by specifying a source, destination, and date(s). Source and destination could be either a city or an airport. I want to search for one-way or round-trip flights.

As a visitor, I want to view flight details, including departure/arrival times, duration, and layovers.

As a visitor, I want to have an auto-complete dropdown to suggest cities and airports as I type in the source or destination field.

As a visitor, I want a date picker dropdown to easily select travel dates.

Hotel management
As a user, I want to add my hotel to the platform. A hotel has name, logo, address, location, star-rating, and several images.

As a hotel owner, I want to define room types, with each type having a name (e.g., twin, double, etc.), amenities, prices per night, and several images.

As a hotel owner, I want to view and filter my hotel’s booking list by date and/or room type.

As a hotel owner, I want to cancel a hotel reservation, so that I have flexibility in managing my hotel.

As a hotel owner, I want to view room availability (per room type) for specific date ranges to better understand occupancy trends..

As a hotel owner, I want to update the number of available rooms of each type in my hotel.If availability decreases, it may require canceling some existing reservations.

Hotel search
As a visitor, I want to search for hotels by check-in date, check-out date, and city. I also want to filter them by name, star-rating, and price range. Search results should display in a list that shows the hotel information, starting price, and a location pinpoint on a map. The results should only reflect available rooms.

As a visitor, I want to view detailed hotel information, including room types, amenities, and pricing.

As a visitor, I want to view the availability and details of different room types for my selected dates in a selected hotel.

Booking
As a user, I want to book an itinerary that includes a flight (one-way or round-trip) and/or a hotel reservation.

As a user, I want to a checkout page that displays all details about my itinerary (flight and/or hotel), collects my credit card information, validates the card details, and finalizes the booking if everything is correct. Note that Validation means statically checking the validity of the card number and expiry date. The card should not (and cannot) be charged for real.

As a user, I want to see hotel suggestions for the city if I am flying to. I also want to see flight suggestions if I am about to book a hotel stay. Both suggestions must have a link to take me to the main hotel/flight search page with pre-filled inputs, while preserving my current, in progress order.

As a user, I want to receive an minimal, PDF invoice for my trip booking, so that I have a record of the booking and transaction.

As a user, I want to view my bookings, so that I can easily access my itinerary and booking information.

As a user, I want to cancel all or specific parts of a booking, giving me flexibility in managing my trips.

As a user, I want to verify my flight booking to ensure the flight schedule remains as planned.

Notifications
As a user, I want to receive notifications when I book a new itinerary, and when there are external changes to my booking (e.g., cancellation by me or hotel owner).

As a hotel owner, I want to receive notifications when a new booking is made for my hotel.

As a user or hotel owner, I want to see the number of unread notifications as a badge and have it updated as I read them.

User experience
As a visitor, I want a clean and intuitive user interface that allows me to navigate the platform effortlessly.

As a visitor, I want the website to be rendered well in different screen sizes (e.g., monitors, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), ensuring accessibility and usability across devices.

As a visitor, I want to option to toggle between dark and light modes, so that I can choose the most comfortable viewing experience.

Advanced Flights System
Unlike hotels, flight data is not stored in FlyNext's internal database. Instead, FlyNext integrates with a centralized external system called Advanced Flights System (AFS) for managing flight-related operations. AFS provides APIs to retrieve data on cities, airports, airlines, and flight bookings. AFS is the repository of all flights, and you will search, book, and verify through it.

The system is hosted at https://advanced-flights-system.replit.app. The Postman collection of the APIs is available here here. Moreover, Swagger-style API docs can be found here here. They can be imported to Swagger Editor. The list of APIs, information about authorization, API descriptions, and request and response formats are all outlined there.

AFS' source code is located here. You do not need to run it locally. However, it is recommended to refer to the code as an example of a full-fledged Next.js application that uses Prisma and TypeScript.

Important note: The users must never directly interact with the AFS API. All communication with AFS must go through your backend server to protect third-party API keys and ensure secure integration. Lecture 8 contains an extensive discussion on the necessity of protecting third-party APIs. Thus, during the interview, the TAs will only call your backend server (not any other server). You will not receive any marks for APIs that are hosted elsewhere.

Authorization
All AFS APIs are authenticated. They require the x-api-key header, which must be equal your API key. Your API key is the output of running the sha-256 hash on your student number. This is an obscure but unique number that can be obtained here. Keep that number secure and do not expose it to others, including the client apps.

Note that you must put your API key into the header, exactly as produced by the hashing function -- without quotations, prefixes, or suffixes.
Note 4: You need to implement the project using REST, Next.js, Prisma, React (next part), TailwindCSS (next part), and Docker (next part). Using alternative frameworks (such as GraphQL, Angular, Django, Sequelize, etc.) is not allowed.

part 2 (frontend):
In this part, you will implement the React frontend of FlyNext and connect it to your backend server. You will also make your app portable via Docker and deploy it to the internet. The deliverable is a portable, deployed, fully functional website that is polished, user-friendly, and production-ready.
At this part, you will implement all user stories listed in the part 1. Use React and TailwindCSS to deliver a single-page and responsive UI. You can modify any part of the backend code as well.
ontainerization
Your deliverable is a portable app. a docker-compose.yaml file along with your Dockerfiles should be present. The Docker Compose file should include every software needed to run your app in a new environment. That includes your Next.js app, the Postgres database (described below), an nginx server to manage the incoming requests, etc.

The Docker build phase should build your Next.js app. In other words, the servers must run in production mode to take advantage of all available optimizations.

Using TypeScript
Implement all of your part 2 code in TypeScript. To fully leverage the advantages of TypeScript and Monorepo, migrating your Part 1 code to TypeScript is strongly recommended. However, since that might take a considerable amount of time, you will receive a small bonus if your system is fully type-safe (backend, frontend, and their interaction).

Change of database
In this part, you will switch to Postgres as your database system. You will need to modify the schema file and delete all previous migrations. Please note that all your existing data will be lost. If that data is important, ensure that you create a backup before proceeding.

Local AFS (bonus)
You will receive bonus marks for running AFS locally. To do so, download the code from here and add the AFS setup to your Docker Compose file.

Consult the README file of the repository for instructions on running the AFS server and importing the data.

User experience
You must prioritize user experience (UX) to ensure that users can navigate the application seamlessly without the need for external guidance. Think about the websites you have left because you could not find the page you were looking for, or where parts of buttons were unresponsive due to frontend bugs. In such cases, you likely did not consider the effort spent by the backend and frontend engineers, or the functionality of other parts of the app. You left the website, and that was a loss of a potential customer for that business.

While our evaluation will be constructive and not as harsh, you should be aware that the marking scheme differs from traditional projects, where the primary focus is on whether the code works. You will lose marks if your web app is slow (takes too long for actions to complete), incomplete (lacks essential functionality), or contains major or minor infrastructure/UI/UX issues.

The web application should provide a smooth experience across devices with varying screen sizes. A smooth UX also involves a seamless single-page experience, front-end validations, in-place error handling, asynchronous requests, and efficient re-rendering.

Note: This course is not focused on UI design, so you will not be graded on the visual appearance of the website as a designer would be. However, you must adhere to the common sense in your UI design. Your UI should make a positive first impression, and navigating your website should be an enjoyable experience for users. A basic UI that clearly reflects the default styles of a framework (e.g., Bootstrap) is not considered an engaging or delightful user experience.

Note 2: Even though this is a single-page application, your website must include distinct pages. The browser's URL should be updated to reflect navigation, allowing users to move through different sections with the back/forward buttons or revisit specific pages via their URL. Different sections of the app must be easily accessible through a navigation bar. A user dropdown for viewing/editing the profile, manage bookings and hotels, and logout is also required. Users should never need to manually modify the URL. Beyond these requirements, the content of the pages and the choice of the landing page are at your discretion. We recommend that the landing page includes a search feature with two tabs for switching between flights and hotels, with results displayed immediately below.

Pre-populated database
Unlike in the previous part, your application should not start with an empty database. Pre-existing data significantly enhances the presentation of your project. In a real-world scenario, business owners would not want to navigate a blank website with only a few entries. To effectively showcase your project, it is recommended that you include at least 50 hotels with complete information across various cities. You may utilize generative AI to assist with generating this data.

However, note that data should be imported as part of Docker compose setup. Do not attempt to push the database into your repository.

Deployment
Your web app should be deployed to the internet. If your Docker Compose is correctly set up, the deployment process should be quick and straightforward. Simply SSH into a cloud virtual machine, clone the repository, and start Docker Compose.

Hosting your website on the internet will be a valuable asset in future presentations or job interviews. However, note that the TAs still run and test your application locally. This ensures that your application is truly portable and can easily be started on fresh environments.

Note: You do not need to buy a domain. You may provide the IP address of your server instead. Also, major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP) offer free plans. Do not opt for paid options, as we will not be able to reimburse any incurred expenses.

Note 2: If your deployed application is accessible via the HTTPS protocol, you will receive a small bonus.
